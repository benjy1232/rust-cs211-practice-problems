# Rust Practice Problems
This is me giving a go at trying some practice problems in my "Introduction to Programming" class in rust as opposed to C++.
It is just to give it a shot and see how I feel about rust and how it compares to the two other langauges I am proficient in, C/C++ and C#.
So far this is something that I am enjoying however the way in which user input is read can be annoying as the parsing can't be done in one line without it getting long and messy.
